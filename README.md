#Guessing_Game

##guessing game for day 1

I have lots of favorite foods but wanted people to guess what they might be. There is a number one best food, of course, but there are other options that are also quite delicious. I wanted a guessing game where people could guess a top "best food" and still get a nice message. However, the best food on the planet has the nicest, winning message. If no "best foods" are guessed, the person gets a message that they are incorrect. 

To do this I utilized if, else if, else statements. 

I received help for this from our Code Academy work, our instructor Brook, and from W3 schools. 

Hope you can guess the best food in the planet!!
